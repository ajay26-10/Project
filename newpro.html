                <article>Sneaki Design was formed by a group of friends who shared a vision to create gadgets for taking with you everywhere. Their first attempt, the Halohub, did not go well, but learned some valuable lessons. After a two year hiatus they are back with a new project. With Ivan, electronic engineer and amateur photographer, leading the charge, the team has created SwitchLens to disrupt and blur the line between mobile and professional photography. Of course, doing such a project is not easy. Learning from their previous mistakes, the team understood they needed more initial feedback and also strong partners in the industry. For a wider range of feedback, they were at exhibitions in April gathering criticism. Then, the team also found reliable and experienced partners on the manufacturing side. With these improvements, they have set up SwitchLens to be a success.</article>
